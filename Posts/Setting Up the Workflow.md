# Setting Up the Workflow

My 2015 MacBook Air is giving out on me (specifically its 'R' and 'E' keys).
I tried erasing the startup disk to no avail.
Now I am waiting for a nifty new 14" MacBook Pro üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

These repeated fresh installs inspired me write down the steps for setting up my quantitative Sociology grad student work flow.
I figure here is as good as anywhere to record everything.

## Set Up R
1. [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) 
2. [Install R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Set Up Word Processor
3. Install Sublime Text
4. Install Package Control from menu
5. Quit Sublime Text, delete my /Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/User folder, create a symlink pointing to my cloud folder I use to sync settings and packages[^1] across computers. (I learned how to create a cloud folder of Sublime settings and packages from Yashu Mittal over [here](https://blog.codecarrot.net/how-to-sync-sublime-text-packages-and-settings-across-multiple-computers-with-cloud-storage/).)


## Setting Up the Rest

1. Install Firefox
2. Install Things to-do list app by Cultured Code.
