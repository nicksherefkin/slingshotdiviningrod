## About

I play games, study with sociologists, and appreciate my surroundings. I like to write about play, democratic action, and Buddhist practice.

This blog is a playground for my ideas and an archive of past interests and entertainments.

## Blogging inspirations (ordered by 2nd letter of first name/word):

- [Haley Nahman](https://haleynahman.substack.com) puts her fingers on a pulse of American culture and shares the beat with humor and thoughtfulness.
- [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/) host a venerable, internet dreamcatcher of a blog.
- [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/) plays with sociological ideas. He also shares and explains handy little bits of R code that can be particularly useful for data wranglers.
- [Mike Rugnetta](https://rugnetta.com) is my internet intellectual idol. He produces prolifically, I consume consummately, and I am never disappointed.
- [Andrew Gelman](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu) has fostered an incredible community of scientists who are genuinely and tirelessly concerned with the transparency, veracity, and inclusivity of science. This is a great place to see skepticism harnessed constructively. 
- [Sorry Watch](https://sorrywatch.com) studies apologies from all over time and social space. Their writing has transformed how I think and feel about harm, moral responsibilities, and restorative justice.
