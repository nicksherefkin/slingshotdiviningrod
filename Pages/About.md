# About me

I research organizational creativity, flexibility, and change. When do groups move by their own idiosyncrasies and when are they beholden to external rules and expectations?

My longterm research aspiration is to inspire groups to organize in ways that better generate and tolerate novel behaviors, ideas, and objects.
