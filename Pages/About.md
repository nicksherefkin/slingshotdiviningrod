# About me

I research organizational creativity, flexibility, and flow. When do groups move by their own idiosyncrasies and when are they beholden to external rules and expectations?

My long-term research aspiration is to inspire groups to organize in ways that better generate and tolerate changing behaviors, ideas, and objects.
